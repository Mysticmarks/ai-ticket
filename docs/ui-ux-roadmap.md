# UI/UX Roadmap and Interaction Strategy

The current AI Ticket release ships a first-party React/Vite dashboard compiled into the Docker image and served from the
`/dashboard` route. It provides dark-mode theming, hue adjustments, live metrics tiles, and keyboard shortcuts for core views.
This document captures the evolution path for that experience so the interface matures alongside the service.

## Planned UI layers

1. **Operations dashboard enhancements (in progress)**
   * Purpose: broaden the existing dashboard with deeper health insights, retry/error statistics, and environment banners.
   * Technology: continue iterating on the bundled React SPA with server-driven configuration for runtime toggles.
   * Data sources: expand structured metrics and stream snapshots already exposed by the backend SSE feeds.
2. **Prompt history explorer**
   * Purpose: allow operators to inspect inputs/outputs for auditing and debugging.
   * Technology: extend the dashboard with paginated views backed by a persistence layer (initially SQLite, later pluggable).
3. **Admin configuration panel**
   * Purpose: manage backend targets, retry budgets, and feature flags without redeploying.
   * Technology: server-rendered forms to minimise JavaScript requirements; stored configuration persists to disk or a secrets
     manager depending on deployment profile.

## Customisation and theming

* **Design tokens** – adopt CSS custom properties for colours, spacing, and typography, allowing operators to override themes via
  a single stylesheet or environment-provided JSON.
* **Accessibility** – ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios by default; provide high-contrast and dark-mode palettes out of the box.
* **White-labelling** – separate logo/branding assets into a dedicated `/theme` directory loaded dynamically at runtime so that
  distributors can replace them without forking the codebase.

## Keyboard shortcut plan

* **Global navigation** – `g + h` (dashboard home), `g + p` (prompt history), `g + c` (configuration panel).
* **Table interaction** – `j/k` for row navigation, `enter` to expand details, `shift + /` to display shortcut reference.
* **Command palette** – introduce `cmd/ctrl + k` for fuzzy-searching actions, mirroring modern developer tooling.

All shortcuts will include visual hints and be configurable through user preferences persisted in local storage (web UI) or a user
profile endpoint once authentication is introduced.
