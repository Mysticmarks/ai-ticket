# High-Throughput Asynchronous Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the proposed architecture to support high-throughput, low-latency operations across asynchronous workers, message queues, and streaming APIs. It also enumerates UI/UX surfaces, autonomous workflow features, and evaluates enabling technologies (FastAPI, WebSockets, GPU inference) for future scalability.

## Core Architectural Components

### 1. Asynchronous Worker Topology
- **Worker Pools**: Deploy specialized worker pools (ingestion, orchestration, inference, post-processing) managed by a central scheduler (e.g., Celery, Dramatiq) to allow horizontal scaling and resilience.
- **Task Prioritization**: Implement multi-level queues that separate latency-sensitive requests from batch jobs. Priority inheritance ensures critical tasks are never starved.
- **Backpressure Management**: Instrument queue depth metrics and dynamic worker scaling via autoscaler hooks. Workers publish health heartbeats; the scheduler throttles producers when saturation is detected.
- **Observability**: Embed distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) and structured logging. Metrics (processing time, failure rate, retries) feed into dashboards for real-time monitoring.

### 2. Message Queue Fabric
- **Broker Selection**: Use a durable message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or NATS JetStream) for task dispatch, and Kafka for high-throughput event streaming.
- **Schema Governance**: Define protobuf/Avro schemas with versioning. Consumers use schema registries to handle backward/forward compatibility.
- **Ordering & Idempotency**: Partition queues by tenant/project to preserve ordering. Workers use idempotency keys and transactional acknowledgments to avoid duplicate processing.
- **Dead-Letter & Retry Policies**: Configure exponential backoff queues with dead-letter routing. Failed tasks trigger automated diagnosis hooks and operator alerts.

### 3. Streaming APIs
- **Protocol Choices**: Offer server-sent events (SSE) for lightweight real-time updates, and WebSocket endpoints for bidirectional collaboration. REST endpoints remain for synchronous operations.
- **Event Gateway**: Introduce a gateway that multiplexes streaming sessions, handles authentication, rate limiting, and session stickiness. Token refresh occurs without disrupting streams.
- **Chunked Payloads**: Stream partial inference outputs as chunked messages; clients can display progressive results. Attach metadata (sequence numbers, timestamps, partial confidence) to support reconciliation.
- **Resilience & QoS**: Implement heartbeat pings, automatic reconnection strategies, and configurable QoS tiers (e.g., guaranteed delivery vs best-effort).

## UI/UX Surfaces & Experience Requirements

### CLI
- **Theming**: Provide light/dark themes with ANSI color palettes; adhere to WCAG contrast ratios when possible.
- **Interaction Model**: Offer command autocompletion, contextual help, and progress spinners. For long operations, display streamed output with clear timestamps.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure screen reader-friendly text (no reliance on color alone). Provide high-contrast mode and configurable verbosity levels.

### TUI (Terminal UI)
- **Layout**: Use pane-based dashboards that surface queue metrics, worker status, and live inference streams.
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions between panes, with throttled refresh rates (<60fps) to balance responsiveness and CPU usage.
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard-only navigation, focus indicators, and support for terminal screen readers (e.g., braille displays via BRLTTY).

### Web UI
- **Theming**: System-based theme detection (prefers-color-scheme) with customizable palettes. Include accessible typography and scalable spacing tokens.
- **Animation**: Use motion to provide context (e.g., streaming output fades in). Offer reduced-motion preference that disables non-essential animations.
- **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2.2 AA. Support keyboard navigation, aria-live regions for streaming updates, and transcripts/captions for multimedia. Validate with automated tooling (axe, pa11y) and manual audits.

## Autonomous Workflow Features

### Configuration Wizards
- **Guided Setup**: Step-by-step flows for queue configuration, worker pool sizing, and streaming endpoint provisioning. Use progressive disclosure to minimize cognitive load.
- **Template Library**: Provide presets (development, staging, production) with explanations of trade-offs. Allow exporting/importing configuration manifests (YAML/JSON).

### Safe Defaults & Guardrails
- **Resource Caps**: Predefined limits on concurrency, memory, and GPU allocation to prevent runaway consumption.
- **Security Baselines**: Enforce TLS, authentication policies, and sanitized logging by default.
- **Validation**: Real-time validation of configuration changes with rollback-on-failure. Provide simulation mode to preview impact before applying.

### Recovery Strategies
- **Checkpointing**: Periodic persistence of task states and streaming offsets to durable storage.
- **Auto-Healing**: Detect stuck workers and trigger automated restarts or failover to standby pools.
- **Runbook Integration**: Generate actionable alerts with links to runbooks, including CLI/TUI commands and web console deep links.

### Operational Guardrails
- **Policy Engine**: Define rule sets (e.g., max retry count, allowed queue bindings). Violations raise alerts and can block deployments.
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable logs of configuration changes and administrative actions for compliance.
- **User Segmentation**: Role-based access with least privilege principles. Sensitive actions require multi-factor confirmation.

## Technology Stack Evaluation & Future Enhancements

### FastAPI
- **Strengths**: Async-first design aligns with worker orchestration and streaming endpoints. Automatic docs (OpenAPI) aid developer experience.
- **Enhancements**: Integrate lifespan hooks for warmup/cooldown of worker pools. Utilize dependency injection for configuration, enabling per-tenant customization.
- **Considerations**: Monitor uvicorn/gunicorn workers for optimal concurrency. Pair with Redis for rate limiting and caching.

### WebSockets & Streaming
- **Strengths**: Native WebSocket support in FastAPI enables real-time collaboration and progressive inference delivery.
- **Enhancements**: Add protocol adapters (WebTransport/HTTP3) as adoption grows. Provide fallback to SSE for environments blocking WebSockets.
- **Considerations**: Implement session sharding and sticky routing through the gateway. Evaluate load balancers (NGINX, Envoy) that support WebSocket upgrades.

### GPU Inference Pipeline
- **Strengths**: Enables accelerated model execution for high-volume tasks. Supports batching and mixed precision for throughput.
- **Enhancements**: Introduce a scheduler that dynamically assigns jobs to GPU pools based on model compatibility and load.
- **Considerations**: Use Triton Inference Server or custom gRPC microservice. Monitor GPU utilization, memory, and thermal metrics. Provide CPU fallbacks when GPU capacity is exhausted.

## Roadmap & Next Steps
1. Prototype worker orchestrator with FastAPI integration and baseline observability.
2. Implement schema registry-backed message queue with idempotent task handling.
3. Deliver MVP streaming API supporting SSE and WebSockets with resilient reconnection.
4. Develop UI surfaces (CLI/TUI/Web) with shared design tokens and accessibility tests.
5. Launch configuration wizard and guardrail policy engine with audit logging.
6. Evaluate GPU inference pilot, including auto-scaling and fallback strategies.
